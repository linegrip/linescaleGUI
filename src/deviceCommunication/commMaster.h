 * @brief This file contains the class to control all connected devices
 *
 * The CommMaster handles all communication with the connected devices.
 * It abstracts the different types of connections so from this stage upwards
 * the type of connection doesn't matter anymore.
 *
 * Each device gets a label which is used as an identifier inside the entire code:
 * USB: Port name
 * BLE: tbd
